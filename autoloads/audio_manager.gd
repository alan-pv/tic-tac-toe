## music, and the one place that knows how loud anything is.
##
## Volume lives on the audio buses rather than on each player, so a slider moved
## in the middle of a sound is heard immediately and nothing has to be told
## about it. What the player chose is written to disk here and read back at
## boot, long before any settings screen exists.
##
## Nothing above this file ever has to call it. Music is a convention rather
## than configuration: drop a file where MUSIC_PATHS says and it plays, in every
## scene, for the whole run. Reusing all of this in another project is copying
## this file and the bus layout beside it, and dropping in a music.ogg.
