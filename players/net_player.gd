## A seat in an online match.
##
## Every seat is one of these on every client: the one you own, the one the
## other player owns, and any seat a bot took over. What changes from client to
## client is only who is allowed to *ask* for a move — the mark itself always
## arrives as a confirm from the referee, which is why the turn loop in game.gd
## never learns that the match is online.

## over is just a stream of confirms like any other.
