class_name RoomChat
extends Node

## Carries a ChatPanel's lines over the relay, and narrates who comes and goes.
##
## Nothing here is about tic tac toe: it rides inside the same opaque payload
## every other game message uses, so a new project reuses it by copying this
## file, chat_panel.gd and chat_dock.gd. One line puts a chat in the corner of
## any screen that lives inside a room:
##
##     RoomChat.spawn(self)
##
## Or wire it to a panel you placed yourself:
##
##     var chat := RoomChat.new()
##     add_child(chat)
##     chat.attach(panel)
##
## Names come from the room, never from the message, so nobody can put words in
## somebody else's mouth. The text itself is not checked at all — the relay is
## private, and moderating it would mean reading it.
