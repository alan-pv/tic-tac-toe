## Where the relay lives. One relay serves every game, so the defaults below are
## the published ones and nothing has to be configured to play.


## Use ws:// only over plain http. A page served over https refuses to open a
## ws:// socket (mixed content), so anything published needs wss:// and a real
## certificate, which in turn needs a domain name: an IP will never match one.
@export var url: String = "wss://play.alan-pv.com/ws"

## Keeps one relay usable by several games: rooms are only ever listed to
## clients that asked for the same id. A new game changes this line alone.
