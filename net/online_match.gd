## The tic tac toe half of the network: one match, refereed by the host and
## replayed identically by the other player.
##
## Above it, game.gd only ever sees Players emitting picked(), so the turn loop
## is the same code offline and online. Below it, Rooms only ever sees opaque
## dictionaries, so the relay never learns what a board is.
##
## The whole networked state of a match is the ordered list of confirmed cells.
## Whose turn it is, what the score is and who opens the next round, every
## client works out for itself from (config, moves): both are transmitted
## explicitly and nobody decides anything on their own.
